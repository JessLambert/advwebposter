				<p id="introparagraph"> <b>Net Neutrality</b> is the way the internet has always existed (at least in the US). You can visit any site you’d like, 
				at any time, and only interact with features that you choose to. Most importantly, you can share and find information without corporate interference or privacy invasions. </p>

				<p id="introparagraph2"> Companies and corporate interest want to change this - without net neutrality, they would be free to charge for you to access certain sites, and potentially limit the information you could access altogether.</p>

				<p id= "introparagraph3">
					That sucks.

			<p id="reasononetexttwo">You could still get some speed - depending on what you’re looking at. Verizon.com might come in super fast, but your provider could make it so that competitors in the market, free speech sites, and even news would be slower for sites that would be determined by your provider. Considering the monopoly providers already have over areas of the US, you couldn’t even switch to a competitor and would have to deal with whatever internet speeds the company wants to give you. No one likes a loading screen.	</p>

			<p id="reasontwotext">  What if all those Wikipedia popups asking for money were paywalls? You’d never get your homework done.  </p>


			<p id="reasontwotexttwo"> Sites still have the option of putting in paywalls to support their companies, but what if you had to pay your provider directly every time you wanted to watch Netflix? Parties hosting their sites could be charged for [Insert Provider Here]’s customers to have access to the site. Or worse, your provider could block sites, like competitors, to prevent you from finding certain information. In all of the equations, it’s your money and the money of people whose content you enjoy that would be going into the already deep pockets of cable companies.	</p>

			<p id="reasonthreetext">  So maybe you’re pissed off at your provider, and you want to see if anyone else is having the same problems you are. But those results won’t even appear for you. </p>

			<p id="reasonthreetexttwo">  The beauty of the internet is the extreme freedom. If you want to look at My Little Pony porn, the internet doesn’t judge you. If you want to voice your discontent with a service, the internet welcomes this and can even connect you with others just as annoyed. Most importantly, information can be shared without interference, so that the truth is available to every- one. Being able to hear the voices of others without censorship has turned the internet into a powerful platform for social change.	</p>

			<p id="censortext"> The civil rights of none shall be abridged on account of religious belief or worship, nor shall any national religion be established, nor shall the full and equal rights of conscience be in any manner, or on any pretext, infringed. The people shall not be deprived or abridged of their right to speak, to write, or to publish their sentiments; and the freedom of the press, as one of the great bulwarks of liberty, shall be inviolable. The people shall not be restrained from peaceably assembling and consulting for their common good; nor from applying to the Legislature by petitions, or remonstrances, for redress of their grievances.</p>

			<p id="reasonfourtext">  Imagine that instead of the super fast internet speeds you like paying less than $100, you had zero other options. </p>

			<p id="reasonfourtexttwo"> People already hate ads. YouTube introducing ads was an affront to our human sensibilities - now it’s everywhere. Imagine if cable compa- nies were the ones in charge of every page you looked at. You think there would even be the option for an ad-free experience? You’d be generating huge amounts of money for them while paying more for your internet - at the low , low cost of whatever they decide to charge.	</p>
